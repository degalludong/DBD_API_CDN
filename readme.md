All files were extracted by fiddler, by datamining communicating with Dead by daylight client and server(CDN).
Some files were decrypted in AES type. 
All JSON has been beautified. jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com
Some config settings or data filed that can be used to specify me in BHVR, was redacted in <redacted>. Please understand me.
Some files don't match the originally extracted filename or URL things(name or path).
I can upload more versions(DEVS, QA, UAT, ) or more files to refers if I could. If anything I could refer to or anything updated but not applied yet, I would be happy if you let me know.
I don't own any copyright of this, you are free to use these things stuffs, but I don't guarantee any responsibility about BHVR's rights or rules. All using this or abusing result is responsible to own yours.
Please don`t bother me asking about the meaning of files or field datamined.
